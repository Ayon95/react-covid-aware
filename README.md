# COVID Aware Game

A COVID-19 awareness-building game. The player will be asked 10 questions about the various COVID-19 safety measures and restrictions in Ontario. The player will have to guess the zone in which a particular restriction applies. In each play, a new set of questions will be asked.

## Technologies used

- React
- React Router
- Sass

## Deployment

Deployed with [netlify](https://netlify.com/).

## Get started

Open up a terminal and clone this repo:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/Ayon95/react-covid-aware.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd react-covid-aware

# Remove current origin repository
$ git remote remove origin

# If you want, you can add a new remote repository
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-github-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
```

Then you can install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Start development server
$ npm start
```

This will start a development server and open the app in your default browser.

## Creating a production build

In your command line, run the following command:

```bash
# create a production build
$ npm run build
```

This will generate a `build` folder in the project root directory. It contains optimized bundled CSS and JS files. You can use this folder to deploy the app to a hosting service like [netlify](https://netlify.com/).
