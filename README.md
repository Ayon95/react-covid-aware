# COVID Aware Game

A COVID-19 awareness-building game. The player will be asked 10 questions about the various COVID-19 safety measures and restrictions in Ontario. The player will have to guess the zone in which a particular restriction applies. In each play, a new set of questions will be asked.

React, React Router, and Sass were used in this project.
